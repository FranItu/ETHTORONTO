Problem
It’s difficult for small artists and content creators to generate funding for their projects. In addition, it is also hard for them to promote themselves and get their names out there.
It sounds like only big artists right now can create NFT collections

Solution:
Creating a platform where artists are able to purchase tokens based on the number of fans they have where they then charge their fans a monthly subscription to access their content. As temporary owners of the NFT’s the fans will gain voting power as to which artists the funding gets directed to. The duration of the voting must be done prior to the expiration date of ownership of the NFT. As the community distributes their votes the funds that are gained through the platform charging transaction fees which can then be distributed to content creators/ artists. Artists will then have the ability to create a tier system on their content. (for example they can output exclusive content that requires a certain membership to access.

USER FLOW
1. Content Creator (CC) creates rentable NFTs with the Calliope Team.
2. CC Rents down NFTs for a month at their decided fare.
2.a. The NFTs are used for exclusive content during the monthly subscription, along with a voting token that makes the renters decide where funds get redistributed.
2.b. The voting token is single use and lasts for the whole time the renter holds the token.
3. 99% of the revenue goes back to the CC. 1% goes to a common pool.
4. At the end of each month the pool gets redistributed to the place where most renters vote.
4.a. Calliope gets 5% from this pool as revenue.
5. The rented NFTs go back automatically to the CC at the end of the month.
